# OpenWes: Open Warehouse Execution System

Welcome to the **OpenWes** documentation! OpenWes is an open-source Warehouse Execution System (WES) designed to optimize warehouse operations, improve efficiency, and integrate seamlessly with modern automation technologies.

## ðŸ“‘ Overview

As automated warehousing becomes increasingly widespread, the traditional connection between **WMS** (Warehouse Management System) and **RCS** (Robot Control System) has been less than ideal. While these two systems work independently, they often fail to collaborate efficiently, creating information silos and inefficient warehouse operations. This is where **OpenWes** comes in - as an open warehouse execution system, OpenWes bridges WMS and RCS, ensuring warehouse operations are both efficient and well-automated.

The Open Warehouse Execution System provides a comprehensive platform for managing warehouse operations, enabling businesses to efficiently handle inventory, coordinate workforce activities, and optimize material flow. This system not only bridges the gap between warehouse management systems (WMS) and actual floor operations but can also function as a standalone WMS solution for facilities that prefer a single, integrated system.
